# Flask Application v2 (GREEN Release) 

This repository represesnts the next version of our sample Python web application. We have changed the word BLUE to GREEN in our Flask web application. Now we can start talking about how we are going to deploy this new version 2 of our Flask App. 

## Deployment Steps

To deploy this sample Python web application from the OpenShift web console, you should select ``python:2.7``, ``python:3.3``, ``python:3.4`` or ``python:latest``, when using _Add to project_. Use of ``python:latest`` is the same as having selected the most up to date Python version available, which at this time is ``python:3.4``.

The HTTPS URL of this code repository which should be supplied to the _Git Repository URL_ field when using _Add to project_ is:

* https://github.com/mwardRH/greenflask.git

If using the ``oc`` command line tool instead of the OpenShift web console, to deploy this sample Python web application, you can run:

```
oc new-app https://github.com/mwardRH/greenflask.git
```

In this case, because no language type was specified, OpenShift will determine the language by inspecting the code repository. Because the code repository contains a ``requirements.txt``, it will subsequently be interpreted as including a Python application. When such automatic detection is used, ``python:latest`` will be used.

If needing to select a specific Python version when using ``oc new-app``, you should instead use the form:

```
oc new-app python:2.7~https://github.com/mwardRH/greenflask.git
```
